## 📘 Overview

India has the highest number of Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals. However, the awareness and adoption of sign language remain limited among families and caretakers.

This project is an ML-powered educational app designed to **teach Indian Sign Language (ISL)** to DHH families and individuals. Developed under the guidance of:

- **Prof. Swaroop Joshi**
- **Prof. Sougata Sen**
- **Prof. Surjya Ghosh**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📚 Educate individuals in Indian Sign Language.
- 🧠 Enhance learning with gesture-recognition powered interaction.
- 🤝 Empower DHH families to communicate effectively and inclusively.

---

## 🧩 Features

The app offers a structured, 3-stage learning path:

1. **Learning Stage**  
   > Introduction to hand signs with visual and audio guidance.

2. **Practice Stage**  
   > Real-time gesture recognition with feedback using MCQs.

3. **Evaluation Stage**  
   > Assesses sign recognition accuracy and provides a performance report.

## 🧠 Machine Learning

- **Data Collection**: Locally collected from DHH homes by our research team.
- **Model**: A custom-trained gesture recognition model.
- **Integration**: Real-time inference integrated into the app for feedback during practice and evaluation.
